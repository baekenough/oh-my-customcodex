## Priority Legend

| Priority | Meaning | SLA |
|----------|---------|-----|
| P0 | Critical — blocks releases or active degradation | Same day |
| P1 | High — security, CI bugs, context pollution | Next release |
| P2 | Medium — improvements, docs, refactoring | Within 2 releases |
| P3 | Low — nice-to-have, long-term enhancements | Backlog |

## Sprint 1: Quick Wins (7 issues, ~1 hour total)

Batch these into 1-2 PRs for maximum efficiency.

| # | Title | Category | Effort | Notes |
|---|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| #284 | Remove stray files (test-delete.txt, go-best-practices/CLAUDE.md) | Chore | 5 min | **Highest ROI** — stops per-session context pollution |
| #286 | Fix R006 context:fork count (9→8) | Docs/Bug | 5 min | 2-line edit |
| #283 | Fix deploy-test.yml branch pattern | CI/Bug | 5 min | 1-line: `release` → `release/**` |
| #292 | Add --frozen-lockfile to release-notes.yml | CI/Bug | 5 min | 1-line change |
| #271 | Add /research to templates/CLAUDE.md | Docs | 10 min | 1-2 lines in .en + .ko |
| #290 | Add explicit permissions to ci.yml + security-audit.yml | Security | 10 min | 2-3 lines per file |
| #272 | Sync EN/KO README table row order | Docs | 15 min | Row reordering |

**Suggested PR grouping**:
- PR A: #284 + #286 (cleanup + docs fix)

- PR C: #271 + #272 (docs sync)

## Sprint 2: Security Hardening (1 issue, ~1 hour)

| # | Title | Category | Effort | Notes |
|---|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| #289 | SHA-pin all 9 GitHub Actions | Security | 1 hour | Use `pin-github-action` CLI tool. Consider adding Dependabot for auto-updates. |

## Sprint 4: Validator & Docs (4 issues, ~6-8 hours)

| #274 | Add validate-docs.ts unit tests | Test | 2 hours | 4 core functions |

**Dependency chain**: #293 → #291 → #282

## Sprint 5: Infrastructure Decision (2 issues)

## Session Quick Reference

When starting a new session, use this to pick the next task:

```
1. Check: Any P0/P1 issues still open? → Fix first
2. Check: Any quick wins remaining? → Batch and ship
3. Check: Any blocked issues now unblocked? → Proceed
4. Otherwise: Pick from current sprint
```
