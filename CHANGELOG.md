## [Unreleased]

## [0.35.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Cost monitoring system**: statusline→hook cost data bridge + cost-cap-advisor hook with 4-level warnings (#339, #340)

- **Dynamic pattern tracking**: task-outcome-recorder now infers workflow pattern (sequential/parallel/evaluator-optimizer/worker-reviewer/orchestrator) (#334)

### Fixed
- **stuck-detector bug**: Fixed `jq -n` → `jq -cn` for compact JSON output — advisory and hard-block detection were silently non-functional (#338)
- **index.yaml**: Added missing 12-workflow-patterns guide entry (#333)

## [0.34.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- `omcustom:` namespace prefix for 14 harness/package skills (Closes #264)
- "When NOT to Use" guard sections for dev-review, dev-refactor, research skills
- Stopping criteria display for worker-reviewer-pipeline and research skills
- Cost estimate display for research skill
- Pattern Selection guide (workflow-patterns.md)
- Step 0 Pattern Selection in task-decomposition skill
- `pattern_used` field in task-outcome-recorder hook
- New evaluator-optimizer skill (general-purpose EO primitive)
- Conditional hard-block (exit 1) in stuck-detector for 5+ consecutive repetitions

### Changed
- Reclassified 4 skills from core to harness scope (analysis, lists, status, help)
- Skills count: 70 → 71

### Fixed
- Sauron verification findings (guide count, context:fork count, template sync)

### Closed

- #328: CI validate-docs false positive
- #329: Documentation informational findings

## [0.33.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **`/deep-plan` skill**: Research-validated planning with 3-phase cycle (Discovery Research → Reality-Check Planning → Plan Verification). Eliminates gap between research assumptions and actual codebase state (#325)

### Fixed
- **validate-docs hook counting**: Fixed false positive where `scripts/` directory was counted as a hook file. Now counts only `.json` files as hooks (#325)

## [0.32.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Update awareness** (`doctor --updates`): detects when installed oh-my-customcode version is behind the latest npm release and reports available updates (#313)
- **Session advisory**: notifies users at session start when a newer version is available (#314)
- **Protected files**: lockfile module now tracks protected files to prevent accidental overwrites (#315)

### Changed
- **Lockfile module refactor**: centralized `COMPONENT_PATHS`, added `readLockfile` validation, extracted common helpers (#317)

### Fixed

## [0.31.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Ontology-RAG routing enrichment (R019)**: All 4 routing skills (secretary, dev-lead, de-lead, qa-lead) now call `get_agent_for_task` to inject `suggested_skills` into spawned agent prompts. MCP failure is silently skipped — routing is never blocked.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive 13-section architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams (EN + KO)
- **Docs validator as release gate**: CI now validates documentation consistency before release
- **Phantom slash command detection**: Validator detects commands listed in README without corresponding skill directories
- **Flutter development support**: New `fe-flutter-agent`, `flutter-best-practices` skill, and 4 Flutter guides

### Fixed
- **graph_score=0 bug** in ontology-RAG router: `route_with_hybrid()` now passes keyword-best match as `anchor_node` to `hybrid_searcher.search()`, enabling graph proximity scoring (confidence 0.15→0.30+ range)
- **Ontology-RAG MCP server configuration** restored (#294)
- **Korean query routing**: Added particle stripping for mixed Korean-English queries
- **SHA-pin all GitHub Actions** for supply chain security across 12 workflows
- **Guides migration**: All agent/skill references migrated to `templates/guides/` (single source of truth)
- **Flutter `color.withOpacity()` deprecation**: Replaced with `color.withValues()` in performance guide
- **CLAUDE.md count accuracy**: Skills, rules, and guides counts corrected

### Changed
- **Guides architecture**: Root `guides/` removed from git tracking; `templates/guides/` is canonical source
- **java21 guides** moved to `templates/guides/` (#270)
- **README EN/KO alignment**: Structure and ordering synchronized
- **Sprint 1-4 code quality**: java21 refs, rule dedup, guides sync, validator improvements

## [0.23.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Manifest version desync** : `templates/manifest.json` version was stuck at `0.3.0` while package.json was at `0.23.1`, causing `omcustom update` to incorrectly report "no updates available" for users with existing installations

### Added
- **CI version sync guard**: New CI job `version-sync` verifies `package.json` and `templates/manifest.json` versions match on every PR

## [0.23.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **dry-run modifies files** (Issue #220): `omcustom update --dry-run` no longer modifies CLAUDE.md or config — entry doc update and config save are now guarded by dry-run check
- **Content loss on update** (Issue #221): `omcustom update` now preserves existing project-specific CLAUDE.md content when no omcustom markers exist, instead of overwriting it entirely

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- claude-native checker upgraded: new frontmatter fields, hooks analysis, expanded doc pages, model update
- Hook scripts updated with dual Agent/Task tool comments

### Fixed
- hooks.json matchers silently broken in Claude Code v2.1.63+ due to Task→Agent rename (Issue #218)

## [0.22.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Fixed MCP tool name references in sys-memory-keeper agent — session-end saves now correctly invoke `mcp__plugin_claude-mem_mcp-search__save_memory` and `mcp__plugin_episodic-memory_episodic-memory__search`
- Updated R011 (SHOULD-memory-integration) rule with correct tool names

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
