# Hada Scout

Automated pipeline that monitors hada.io (via feedburner RSS) for AI agent, harness, benchmark, and eval-related articles, then runs `/scout` analysis on each match. As of v0.5.22, broad GeekNews/HN/arXiv monitoring is handled by the GitHub Actions `daily-scout` workflow; this page remains for the legacy hada-specific k8s flow.

## Overview

hada-scout is the legacy hada.io-specific k8s pipeline. The v0.5.22 `daily-scout` GitHub Actions workflow supersedes broad monitoring with multi-source feeds and OpenAI pre-scoring, while this skill documents the narrower historical benchmark/evaluation flow. Tracked in GitHub Issue #841 and deprecation port #1493.

## Key Details

- **Scope**: package
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **User-invocable**: no
- **Infrastructure**: `infra/hada-scout/`

## Architecture: 2-Layer Hybrid

### Layer 1 — check-feed.sh (feed → issues)

Fetches hada.io feedburner RSS, filters entries by keyword regex, deduplicates against existing `hada-scout` issues, and creates a GitHub issue per match with labels `hada-scout` + `pending-scout`.

### Layer 2 — scout-runner.sh (issues → /scout)

Finds open issues with `pending-scout` label, extracts source URL from issue body, runs `codex --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "/scout {url}"` (max 5 per run), parses verdict, applies verdict label, and removes `pending-scout`.

## Keyword Strategy

hada-scout uses harness/benchmark/eval focused keywords, distinct from geeknews-scout's broader AI agent coverage:

```
harness|benchmark|eval|evaluation framework|agent framework|코드 리뷰 자동화|하네스|벤치마크|평가
```

geeknews-scout handles: `Claude|Anthropic|MCP|AI agent|에이전트|agentic|multi-agent|...`

## Label Scheme

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `hada-scout` | Source identification — all hada-scout created issues |
| `pending-scout` | Awaiting /scout analysis (Layer 1 sets, Layer 2 clears) |
| `scout:internalize` | /scout verdict: adopt into project |
| `scout:integrate` | /scout verdict: use as external dependency |
| `scout:skip` | /scout verdict: not relevant |

## Cost Controls

Layer 2 runs at most **5 /scout executions per cron invocation**. Each /scout call costs ~$0.5–1.5 (sonnet). Remaining `pending-scout` issues are processed in the next scheduled run.

## Deployment

Legacy K8s CronJob structure mirrors `infra/geeknews-scout/`, hosted on the `ubuntu-ext` cluster. New broad scouting should use `.github/workflows/daily-scout.yml` instead of deploying another k8s CronJob.
