# Research

10-team parallel deep analysis with cross-validation for complex research tasks.

## Overview

Spawns 10 parallel research agents (Agent Teams when available, R018) to analyze a topic from different angles simultaneously. Each team investigates a specific aspect (architecture, security, performance, ecosystem, etc.), then a synthesizer agent aggregates findings with cross-validation. Produces a comprehensive research report saved to `.claude/outputs/`. Designed for complex architectural decisions or technology evaluations.
