# Release Plan

Generate release-unit development plan from verify-done issues.

## Overview

Reads GitHub issues labeled `verify-done`, groups them into cohesive release units, generates an ordered implementation plan, and assigns agents per issue type. Output is a structured release plan with issue list, agent assignments, verification steps, and estimated complexity. Input to the auto-dev pipeline. Run after `professor-triage` has labeled and prioritized issues.
