# Structured Dev Cycle

6-stage structured development cycle with stage-based tool restrictions.

## Overview

Enforces a disciplined 6-stage cycle: Plan (Read-only) → Verify Plan → Implement (all tools) → Verify Implementation → Compound testing → Done. Stage transitions are enforced via a `/tmp/.claude-dev-stage` marker file checked by PreToolUse hooks. Recommends opus for planning stages, sonnet for implementation, haiku for Done. Supports Codex hybrid in Stage 3 and Agent Teams for complex tasks (R018). Full cycle for 10+ file changes; abbreviated for smaller tasks.
